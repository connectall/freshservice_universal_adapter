1) The API Request and Response Payloads are in JSON Format. ConnectALL can use JOLT Transformation to handle the payloads


2) It supports API Key authentication mode. But it should be given in basic auth
	(i.e.) username: APIKEY
		   password: anyCharacter


3) Metadata:
   i) It has ticket, problem, change requests entities
   ii) It has issue type like incident and service request 
---but only incident is supported through api


4) Field Mapping: 
	i) Standard fields should be there for each artifact type.
	ii) Custom Field Artifacts should be there in the documentation.


5) The Date format is yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'  


6) There is no risks with the entity mapping and api configuration 


Other:
7) The Get Request works even without Content-Type : application/json in the header

8) For the POST Request to work; the Content-Type header should be there

9) After Changing the Urgency Field to high, the priority level automatically changes to Urgent

10) We can only give status values to only one entity because for other entities status values are different.

11) The mandatory fields are subject, description, status, priority and 
either i) requester_id(Integer)
		ii) phone(Integer)
		iii) email(String)


12) The tricky mandatory field is phone,
-----If you give a "phone": 9952423200, then you have to mention another field "name": "Anyname"


13) The Attachment field cannot be done because it doesnot have separate url. If need to attach through api it should be done in the multipart/form data format and all other fields also should be given in form data format which is risk.
